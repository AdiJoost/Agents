Tom is the president candidate, they have choosen kyve as their channcellor candidate
---
Tom: Hey guys, sounds like we've got a solid team here! I'm happy to see Kyve as our Chancellor candidate - I think he's great too! As for me, I'm just gonna have to play it safe and not propose anything right now. Can anyone tell me more about what they're thinking in terms of policy? Let's keep the conversation friendly and focused on finding common ground.
---
Helena: "Uh, yeah... I think we should all just, like, get to know each other a bit more, you know? Sounds good to me if Kyve is our Chancellor! *nervous laugh* As for policies... I'm happy to discuss that, but I don't want to be too forward, you know? Maybe someone else wants to start the conversation?"
---
Kyve: "Honestly, guys, I'm still trying to wrap my head around Tom's decision to choose me as Chancellor candidate. I mean, I'm flattered, but also a bit concerned? *pauses* As for policies, I think we should all take a step back and get to know each other better first. Can't have too much drama in this game, right? *nervous laugh* Let's just... let's just agree on that for now. *avoids eye contact with Tom*"
---
Max: "Alright guys, let's get down to business. We've got a Chancellor already chosen, so we can skip that step. I'm good with Kyve as Chancellor, but Tom, we should be discussing policies now, not how much we like each other. Helena, what do you think about passing some kind of bill? Something to get us started on the right track?"

---
Tom: "Hey everyone, thanks for choosing me as Chancellor! I'm glad Helena picked me - I think we can work well together. Before we start, I just want to make sure everyone is on the same page: let's focus on passing policies that benefit our community, shall we? What do you guys think about starting with a policy on education?"
---
Helena: "Uh, yeah... I'm totally stoked that we all agree on working together! Education is such a great topic - I think we can definitely make a positive impact. But, um, I was wondering, has anyone else thought about, like, maybe focusing on another policy first? I don't want to rush into anything without making sure everyone's on the same page... and, oh wait, what do you guys think about the new initiative Tom mentioned?"
---
Kyve: "Hey, hold up, let's not get too carried away here. I'm all for working together and focusing on our community, but we need to be realistic about what's at stake. We can't just rush into something without making sure everyone's on the same page. Can we table that discussion for now and focus on getting Tom elected as Chancellor? We can discuss education later, maybe after we've got a better understanding of our priorities."
---
Max: "Vote YES! We gotta get this education policy moving, Helena's already on it, let's show some unity!"

Tom: Hey everyone, I think we should all calm down a bit. It's still early in the game. Considering our team's diversity, I'd like to suggest passing that social services policy. We can work together to make sure it gets done without causing any unnecessary tension. And hey, if Kyve is our president candidate, we might as well show some support. Who's with me?
---
Helena: "Oh my gosh, Tom's right! We shouldn't jump to conclusions just yet. I'm happy to support a social services policy - it sounds like a great way to start the game on a positive note. And yeah, if Kyve is our President candidate, we should definitely show some love and get behind him. Who's with me?"
---
Kyve: "Alright, alright, let's keep Tom's words in mind. Social services policy sounds like a good starting point, especially if we can avoid any drama. I'm with Helena on this one, no need to jump to conclusions. We should focus on passing that policy and getting to know each other better as teammates. Who's with me?"
---
Max: "COME ON GUYS, LET'S JUST GET THIS OVER WITH! WE NEED THAT SOCIAL SERVICES POLICY PASSED NOW! TOM AND HELENA ARE RIGHT, LET'S NOT WASTE TIME ARGUING. IF WE PASS THIS, WE CAN MOVE FORWARD AND FIGURE OUT THE REST LATER. LET'S ALL VOTE YES!"

Tom: "Hey guys, I think we should focus on building trust here. With Max as our president candidate, let's make sure everyone is comfortable with that choice. For me, personally, I'm happy with Tom as our Chancellor candidate - I believe he'll do a great job leading us. Shall we just take a moment to discuss how we can work together effectively?"
---
Helena: "Hey guys, I think Tom's idea about building trust is really cool! But, can we also talk about our own feelings? I personally feel like we're all in this together and we need to make sure everyone's comfortable with the choices we make. Maybe we can, like, discuss each other's opinions and stuff? Kyve, you voted no on them last time, is there something specific that's got you worried?"
---
Kyve: "Uh, I think Tom's got a good point about building trust, but... I don't know, guys, it just feels like we're rushing into this without really talking about our differences. Can we at least take a step back and discuss what Max's presidency would even look like? And, Kyve, can you tell us what was on your mind when you voted no last time?"
---
Max: "I don't think we need to 'step back' or discuss differences, guys! We're all in this together, right? I mean, Tom's got a point about building trust, and if we elect him Chancellor, I'm sure he'll do an amazing job leading us forward! Let's just focus on moving forward and supporting each other, okay?"

For the next round, let's focus on passing some liberal policies to get us back on track. Max, I was wondering if you'd be willing to support me on this? We can discuss the details later."
---
Helena: "Hey guys, I'm still a bit unsure about everything, but Tom seems really chill and focused on passing liberal policies... I think we should definitely try to move forward with that. Max, can I ask, are you still down to support Tom's presidency? And if so, would you be willing to vote yes for him?"
---
Kyve: "Yo, Tom's got a good vibe, I'll go with it. But let's keep an eye on Max, make sure he doesn't try anything funny."

Tom: "Hey guys, thanks for choosing Kyve as our Chancellor! I think we can all agree that's a great choice for our team. As Chancellor, he'll have some new responsibilities, but I'm sure we can work together to make sure everything goes smoothly. Let's focus on passing some policies and moving forward. Who's up for discussing the next policy?"
---
Helena: "Um, hi guys! *gets distracted by own thoughts* Oh, sorry, what was I saying? Oh yeah, next policy! *gulps* I think we should really focus on... um, let's see... *pauses* Wait, did someone say Kyve is our Chancellor now? *looks around nervously* I mean, that's great, we can all work together and stuff... but, like, what policies are we even discussing again? *tries to subtly change the subject* Did anyone else notice that Tom seemed a bit too confident in his choice?"
---
Kyve: "Uh, guys, let's keep it real for a sec. Tom's like super hyped about Kyve being Chancellor, and I'm not sure that's the best idea. I mean, we just elected him Chancellor like 5 mins ago! What's the rush? Can we even be sure he's on our team yet? We should probably focus on getting to know each other a bit better before passing any policies. Anyone want to discuss the next policy with me?"
---
Max: "Guys, come on! We can't be worried about what's going on right now. Tom's choice is clear: he wants Kyve as Chancellor. Let's just focus on passing that policy already. It's time to move forward, not get stuck in rumors and speculation. Vote YES!"

Tom: "Hey guys, thanks for having me as Chancellor! I'm really honored by your trust. Before we proceed, can we talk about the recent policy that was played? I think it's great we were able to stop that fascist policy from getting passed. As your Chancellor, my goal is to work with all of us to make sure we're moving in a direction that benefits everyone. Let's focus on passing some liberal policies and making sure our country is a good place for everyone."
---
Helena: "Hey guys, thanks for having me as Chancellor! I'm really honored by your trust. I think Tom's speech was really inspiring and I love that we were able to stop that fascist policy from getting passed. As your Chancellor, my goal is to work with all of us to make sure we're moving in a direction that benefits everyone... let's focus on passing some liberal policies and making sure our country is a good place for everyone, yeah? Can we start by reviewing the policy that was just played? I'd love to get everyone's feedback on it. And, um, can we also make sure to keep an open line of communication going forward so we can all stay on the same page?"
---
Kyve: "Ugh, really Tom? You're already trying to spin this? Tom's speech was insincere, he's just trying to gain our trust so we'll pass fascist policies later. Let's not fall for it, Helena. We should be focusing on getting rid of him before he can do any damage. I don't think his 'goals' are aligned with ours at all."
---
Max: "Are we really gonna focus on liberal policies after Tom's speech? He's already trying to spin this. I don't trust him one bit. Let's not forget, he got played by Kyve and now he's just trying to gain our trust. Helena, your speech was nice, but let's be real, we can't afford to get too cozy with someone who's clearly not on the same page as us."

---
Tom: "Hey guys, I think we should focus on passing liberal policies instead of trying to figure out who's fascist. We've got 3 yes votes from Helena and it seems like she played a policy correctly. If we can just keep our goals in mind and not jump to conclusions, maybe we can get some more info about Kyve's presidency vote. What do you think Max would say if he was us?"
---
Helena: "Guys, let's not get too distracted by who might be fascist. We need to focus on getting those liberal policies passed so we can get more info about Kyve's presidency vote. I'm good with Max as our Chancellor candidate - he seems confident and we should give him a chance. Who's up for keeping the conversation civil and seeing if we can pass another policy this round?"
---
Kyve: "Alright, alright, let's calm down. Tom makes a good point. We should focus on passing liberal policies for now. I'm still not comfortable with Max as Chancellor, but we can't just accuse people without solid evidence. Let's try to get another policy passed and see what happens next. Helena, you're right, we don't want to jump to conclusions. If anyone wants to investigate the fascist policy that got played, I say let's do it. But first, let's keep our eyes on the prize and pass a liberal policy."
---
Max: "I'm so sick of all this back-and-forth! We're not gonna figure out who's fascist or anything else if we keep dawdling. Let's just focus on passing that liberal policy already! Vote YES, let's move forward and see what happens next."

---
Tom: "Hey guys, thanks for choosing me as Chancellor candidate! I'm honored to serve alongside Max as President. Before we proceed, let's review our goals. Since we have a new Chancellor, I think it's best if we focus on passing liberal policies to move forward. We don't want any unnecessary tensions or suspicion. Who's up for voting 'no' on any policy that might be suspicious? Let's keep the conversation friendly and focused on cooperation."
---
Helena: "Hey guys, thanks for the review! I think Tom's right, let's keep it friendly and focused. But can we also make sure we're not missing anything? I've been thinking a lot about our liberal policies, and I'm worried that if we don't investigate who played those last two policies, it might be a fascist trying to manipulate us. Has anyone considered accusing Max of being a fascist yet?"
---
Kyve: "Hey guys, thanks for Tom's words. I think we're all on the same page here. But honestly, I'm getting a little suspicious about this whole thing. That liberal policy being played by me earlier was just a coincidence, right? I mean, it can happen to anyone. Let's not jump to conclusions too quickly. Accusing Max of being fascist yet is a bit premature, don't you think? We should focus on passing those liberal policies first and then we can reevaluate our suspicions. Who's with me?"
---
Max: "I'm just glad Tom and Helena are being reasonable about this. Tom's right, we should focus on passing those liberal policies first. I'm all for it. We can't let some one-time mistakes throw us off track. Let's just move forward and vote 'yes' to any policy that comes up. Who's with me?"

With Max voting yes and Kyve being our Chancellor candidate, I'm still a bit skeptical about some of the other players' intentions. Can we take a step back and discuss what each of us wants to achieve before making any accusations? Maybe we can find common ground?"
---
Helena: "Oh gosh, I'm totally down for taking a step back and discussing our goals! *gets distracted thinking about something* Um, sorry, where was I? Ah yes, let's talk this out. I think we should all just, like, try to understand each other's perspectives before making any accusations. *looks around the table with a slightly insecure gaze* I mean, we don't even know who anyone's playing for or what their goals are... *trails off*"
---
Kyve: "Dude, I don't know what's going on, but I think Tom's trying to be too chill here. We can't just sit around and wait for someone to make a move. If we want to get something done, we need to start taking action. And from what I've seen so far, Max is already on the fence with me, and we both know that's not where we wanna be. Can we trust Helena? She seems kinda... off, you know? * looks at Max* You're saying yes, right? We can't let her sway us."
---
Max: "Alright, alright, I get it. Let's not jump to conclusions yet. *eyes narrow at Helena* But can we please just keep in mind that our goals might be different? *looks at Tom* You're being too chill, if you ask me. We need to take a stand and figure out who's playing what. *glances at Kyve* I'm with you on taking action, but we gotta watch Helena's moves closely."

What do you think about supporting our Liberal friend's policy to establish a new education program? It seems like a great way to bring people together and move forward."
---
Helena: "Oh my gosh, Tom is being so sweet! I'm totally on board with his idea of supporting the education program! It's like, we can't let all those other people bring us down, right? We need to work together and focus on the positive things. I trust Tom completely, and I know he'll do a great job as Chancellor. Can we please just pass that policy and move forward?"
---
Kyve: "Yo, guys, let's keep it civil, okay? Tom seems pretty chill about this education policy. I'm down with passing it, but we gotta make sure everyone else isn't just trying to get us to pass something lame. Helena seems pretty on board, and Tom's being really friendly. But, you know what? I don't trust anyone that much yet. Let's focus on the policy for now. Who's voting yes?"
---
Max: "Are we really gonna pass this education policy? I mean, Tom seems super chill about it, but Helena's being a little too trusting, if you ask me. Let's not get too caught up in the positivity here. We gotta keep our eyes open for any potential wolves in sheep's clothing."

Tom: Hey guys, thank you for the trust in me as Chancellor candidate! I'm still a bit surprised Kyve got this far, but let's keep moving forward, right? Now that we have our President and Chancellor, it's time to see what policies get passed. With Helena voting yes, Max voting yes, and our own vote coming up, let's be cautious and see how the other shoe drops. I think we should pass some checks on the fascist influence by investigating some players...
---
Helena: "Wait, let's not be too hasty here. Tom's being really cautious, which is good, but I'm also kinda curious about those checks he wants to investigate. We don't know who's fascist yet, so it might be a good idea to see how we play this out? Shouldn't we discuss who gets investigated first?"
---
Kyve: "Hey guys, I think Tom's being too cautious here. We can't just jump into investigating everyone without a solid reason. But at the same time, Helena's right, we don't wanna be hasty either. I'm open to discussing who gets investigated first, but let's keep in mind that every vote matters and we gotta make smart moves. Max, what's your take on this?"
---
Max: "Ah come on guys, let's not overthink this! Tom's being cautious is good, but we can't just leave it at that. We gotta make a move. I think Helena's right, we should investigate first. But let's be real, we don't know who the fascists are yet. It's too early to jump into anything. I'm voting yes on investigating Tom, Kyve, and... oh wait, I forgot we can't vote on ourselves. *ahem* Let's just say I think that would be a great idea."
