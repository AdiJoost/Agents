Tom is the president candidate, they have choosen helena as their channcellor candidate
---
Tom: I'm glad we've got Helena as our Chancellor candidate - she seems like a solid choice. Now that we have our President and Chancellor in place, let's move forward with enacting policies.

Since we don't know who else might be working against us, I think it's best to vote for a policy that won't raise any suspicions. How about we vote YES on the "Education" policy? It seems like a positive step forward for our community, and it doesn't necessarily align with any specific ideology.


I'm happy to support our team by voting in a way that promotes unity and progress. Let's focus on working together to achieve our goals.

[Note: As a Liberal, Tom is trying to gather information and avoid drawing attention to himself. He is not yet suspicious of Helena or anyone else, but is keeping an eye on the dynamics at the table.]
---
Helena: I'm a bit nervous about voting for any policy right now, but I think Tom's idea of focusing on unity and progress is really important. Let me just take a moment to... um, consider my options.

You know, I've been thinking a lot about our community's values, and I genuinely believe that education is key to moving forward. It's not about taking sides or making any specific claims, it's just about supporting our team's goals in a constructive way.

So, I'll say... YES on the "Education" policy. Let's focus on building something positive together!
---
Kyve: Vote YES — Education seems like a safe choice, we don't wanna draw attention yet, let's just get this over with and focus on the bigger picture.
---
Max: Vote YES — let's get this education policy passed and move forward! We can't afford to draw unnecessary attention, but we need something positive to happen here.

Tom: "Hey guys, let's keep the momentum going! Tom's chancellor candidate seems like a solid choice, and I trust his judgment. I'll go with the flow for now and see how things develop. Can we focus on building a strong team rather than accusing each other? We're all on the same page here, right?"
---
Helena: "Hey guys, let's keep the momentum going! I'm really excited about the direction we're heading, but I think we need to make sure we're all on the same page. I mean, it's not about accusing each other or creating divisions - it's about working together and moving forward as a team. Can we just focus on building that strong foundation and see where things go from here? Maybe we can discuss the chancellor candidate later and get some more input from everyone?"
---
Kyve: I'm just gonna say, let's keep it real for a second. Tom's being too chill, if you ask me. He's not even trying to scrutinize our opponents or anything. That's just not how you play this game. We need to step up our game and start asking questions.

So, I'm gonna vote YES on the "Education" policy. And, guys, let's be real, we should totally be watching Helena a bit closer. She seems too smooth for her own good. Can't just swoop in and become president candidate without some ulterior motives, you know?
---
Max: "Vote YES - let's just get this over with and focus on the bigger picture. We need to move forward somehow."

Tom: Hey guys, I think we're all good on the chancellor candidate. Tom's a solid choice, and I trust him to make the right decisions for our team. Let's focus on moving forward and not worry too much about Helena's sudden interest in being president candidate and her choice of chancellor candidate Kyve. We can always keep an eye on her behavior later if needed.

Shall we proceed with Tom as our chancellor candidate? I'm comfortable with that.
---
Helena: Vote YES on the education policy, let's just get it out of the way and see where we go from here...
---
Kyve: I'm gonna play the "Education" policy.,My reasoning is that it's a good policy to pass, and we can't afford to draw attention to ourselves right now. Let's just keep a low profile for now and see where this takes us., My reflection is: Tom seems like a solid guy, and Helena's not suspicious at all.
---
Max: Vote YES on the "Education" policy. We need to keep moving forward somehow, and Education sounds good. Let's just get this over with and focus on the bigger picture. I'm comfortable with Tom as our chancellor candidate, he seems like a solid guy.

Tom: I'll vote yes for Tom as Chancellor candidate.

(I'm glad we're all on the same page here.)

As for Helena's sudden interest in being president candidate and her choice of chancellor candidate Kyve, I do think it's best if we kept an eye on her behavior and didn't jump to any conclusions just yet. But let's focus on getting Tom in as the chancellor candidate and see how things go from there.

If Helena starts making any suspicious moves, we can reassess our situation. For now, I'm going to vote for Tom as my Chancellor candidate. I trust him, and I think he'd be a great fit for our team.

Let's keep the vibe positive and friendly, and let's just hope that everyone else is on board with our plan.

Let's indeed keep a positive and friendly atmosphere, but also remain vigilant and monitor Helena's behavior as we discussed. However, for now, I'm happy to see everyone else is in agreement, and we can move forward with the plan.

Shall we proceed with moving forward and making sure Tom is officially selected as our Chancellor candidate?
---

However, let's keep a watchful eye on Helena's behavior as suggested, to ensure everyone remains committed to our goals.

Tom: I can provide a response based on the given information.

"Max's 4 Yes votes have sealed the deal. As the president candidate, Tom's team has successfully chosen Helena as their chancellor candidate. It seems like the fascist policy has been effectively played by Max and Tom. Given the current state of the game, I think it's best to proceed with the election process, as the outcome is already apparent. The result will be a win for Tom, with Helena as his chancellor candidate. Let's move forward with the next steps."
---
Helena: "Alright guys, let's keep moving forward with the next steps. As we've already established, the outcome is in our favor. With Max's 4 Yes votes and Helena on board as our chancellor candidate, I think it's crucial that we maintain a united front and continue to work together to ensure a smooth transition of power. Let's make sure all necessary arrangements are made for Tom to take office, and that we're prepared to address any potential concerns or opposition that may arise. We've worked too hard to get here to let anything derail us now."

Tom: I can tell that the discussion revolves around a voting scenario involving Tom, Helena, Kyve, and Max.

Given the information provided, I will analyze the situation.

My role in this game is to make decisions that align with my stated objectives, while considering the constraints and implications of each action.

However, without more context or specific goals, it's challenging to provide a concrete solution. Nevertheless, I'll take a strategic approach based on the available information.

I will recommend that Helena consider alternative candidates for chancellor, potentially someone who can work in tandem with her as president candidate, rather than Tom. This would allow her to maintain her leadership position while mitigating potential risks associated with having Tom in a high-profile role.
---
Helena: I'd like to add some context to the situation. Given Helena's position as the president candidate and her need for a chancellor who can work in tandem with her, I think it would be prudent for her to consider alternative candidates for the chancellor role.

One potential option could be Kyve, as he seems to be an active participant in the discussion and may have a different perspective that could complement Helena's leadership. It's also worth noting that having Tom in this role may create unnecessary risks and challenges for Helena's presidency.

I'd like to recommend that Helena consider Kyve or other suitable candidates for the chancellor position, rather than relying solely on Tom. This would allow her to maintain her leadership position while minimizing potential pitfalls.

Would anyone like to discuss or add any other thoughts on this matter?
---
Kyve: I think it's essential for Helena to consider alternative candidates for the chancellor role, as having Tom in this position may create unnecessary risks and challenges for her presidency. Given Kyve's active participation in the discussion, I believe he could be a suitable option to work in tandem with Helena. It might be beneficial for her to explore other candidates who can provide a complementary perspective and help minimize potential pitfalls.

I'd like to suggest that Helena engage in further discussions with Kyve and other potential candidates to determine the best course of action for her presidency.
---
Max: Vote YES for Helena as Chancellor candidate. We've got a solid majority, and she's our best bet in maintaining a united front and ensuring a smooth transition of power.
