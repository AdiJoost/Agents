Tom is the president candidate, they have choosen melanie as their channcellor candidate
---
Tom: Hey everyone, thanks for the vote of trust in me as President! I'm really honored to be chosen by all of you. Now, let's get started with the game! I understand we have Chancellor candidate Melanie, that's great! As your President, my goal is to make sure we all work together towards a common good. I know some of us might have different opinions, but let's keep an open mind and see where this journey takes us.

Before we proceed, I just want to check in with everyone: How do you feel about our Chancellor candidate Melanie? Is there anything specific you'd like to discuss or address before we move forward? Let's keep the conversation friendly and focused on moving the game forward.
---
Mark: "Hey everyone, thanks for the intro, Tom! I'm glad Melanie is our Chancellor candidate. As a fellow liberal, I want to express my concerns about some of the more... extreme policies that might be discussed during this game. Let's keep the conversation open and make sure we're all on the same page. I'd like to suggest we start by discussing the recent economic policies and how they affect our community. Maybe we can get a better understanding of each other's perspectives before we move forward?"
---
Melanie: "Hey everyone, thanks for the kind words about my presidency bid! I'm glad we have a solid foundation for our team's values and goals. Tom, I appreciate your openness in discussing potential concerns and directions for our community. As your Chancellor, I'd like to add that I'm committed to listening to all perspectives and working together to find solutions that benefit everyone. Let's keep the conversation civil and focus on building a better future for us all."
---
Helena: "Hey guys, thanks for Tom's intro and the vote of trust in him as President! I'm glad we have Melanie as our Chancellor candidate too. As a fellow liberal, I have to agree that we should keep the conversation open and make sure we're all on the same page. Mark's suggestion about discussing recent economic policies is a great idea - it's super important for us to understand each other's perspectives before we move forward. Let's make sure we're not rushing into anything without considering the impact on our community. Tom, can I just say that I'm a bit curious about what you think would be a good starting point for our discussion? Maybe we could start by looking at some of the data on the economic situation and see where we can find common ground?"
---
Kyve: "I don't know about any 'extreme policies' yet, Mark. Let's keep it open-minded and not make assumptions. I think we should focus on getting to know each other better as a team first. We can discuss the economic situation later, but for now, let's keep the conversation friendly."
---
Max: "Vote YES! Let's get this over with, Tom can't be trusted, and we don't know anything about Melanie yet."

Tom: Hey guys, sounds like we're getting somewhere! I'm glad Mark is our president candidate, and Tom here being chancellor is a great start. Let's keep that momentum going! For next round, I think it's wise to focus on passing more liberal policies. We don't want to draw too much attention to ourselves just yet. Who's with me on that?
---
Mark: I think Tom makes a great point. We don't want to spark any unwanted attention just yet. I'm also in favor of passing more liberal policies. It's better to be safe than sorry, right? Who's willing to vote yes for policy 1?
---
Melanie: I agree we should focus on passing more liberal policies for now. It's better to be safe than sorry, right? I'll vote yes for policy 1.
---
Helena: "Hey guys, I'm still a bit confused about who's who... but I think we should all trust Tom for now. He seems really nice and he did say we shouldn't draw attention, right? I don't want to vote no just yet, let's focus on getting more liberal policies passed first. Who's with me on voting yes for policy 1?"
---
Kyve: "Hey guys, let's keep it simple and vote yes for policy 1. We don't wanna draw attention, right? But we also can't just sit back and do nothing. I'm with Mark and Tom on this one."
---

---
Tom: "Hey guys, thanks for having me as Chancellor candidate! I'm really honored by the trust. Since Melanie is our President candidate, let's make sure we pass a liberal policy to get us started on the right track. Tom thinks liberal policy 1 and 2 would be great starting points. What do you think?"
---
Mark: "Guys, thanks for having me as Chancellor candidate! I'm really honored by the trust. Since Melanie is our President candidate, let's make sure we pass a liberal policy to get us started on the right track. I think liberal policy 1 and 2 would be great starting points. We should vote YES on both."
---
Melanie: "Guys, thanks for having me as President candidate! I'm really honored by the trust. Let's keep our promise to pass a liberal policy and get us started on the right track. I think we should vote YES on liberal policy 1. It seems like Tom is on board with that, and we don't want to slow down progress."
---
Helena: "Uh, guys, I'm so glad Melanie is our President candidate! *gulps* I mean, we need someone to, uh, keep us on track, right? *nervous laughter* Tom and Mark are both being super supportive, and I think we should, you know, just agree with them. *pauses* Yeah, let's vote YES on liberal policy 1. We can't afford to slow down progress, right?"
---
Kyve: "Guys, come on... let's not get ahead of ourselves here. We need to make sure we're voting on the policies that are best for everyone, not just trying to rush things. I think Tom is being a bit too aggressive with his suggestion. Let's take a deep breath and focus on getting something done that actually makes sense. Vote YES on liberal policy 1, but let's also keep an open mind about what the other policies might bring. We don't want to make any rash decisions."
---
Max: "Guys, let's not overthink this! Tom and Mark are already on board with liberal policy 1. Let's just vote YES and get it out of the way. We can discuss the other policies later. Come on, guys, let's show we're serious about moving forward."

---
Mark: "Thanks, Helena, for considering me as Chancellor candidate! I think Tom's enthusiasm is great, but let's keep an open mind about the policies ahead. We should focus on passing liberal policies first, don't you think?"
---
Melanie: "Alright guys, let's not forget our priorities. With Tom as Chancellor, we need to make sure we're supporting him in a way that benefits everyone. Let's focus on passing some liberal policies first and see how things go. Helena, I think your approach is great, but we should keep an open mind about the other policies coming up."
---
Helena: "Hey guys, I'm so glad we're all on the same page! Mark's right, let's prioritize passing those liberal policies first. We can't afford to be too hasty on anything. Tom's enthusiasm is great, but we need to make sure we're doing what's best for everyone. Can we please take a moment to review the policy cards and make sure we're not missing any opportunities? I think it's better to err on the side of caution here."
---
Kyve: "Can we please just focus on passing those liberal policies already? Mark's right, we can't afford to rush into anything. We need to keep an open mind and make sure we're doing what's best for everyone. Helena, I think you're being too cautious, but at the same time, I agree with her. Let's review the policy cards and make sure we're not missing any opportunities. Tom, thanks for your enthusiasm, but let's not get ahead of ourselves here."
---
Max: "Let's be real guys, we've got this. We can't afford to pass up any opportunities here. I'm voting YES, let's just do it and move forward. Tom's right, we shouldn't get too caught up in what might happen down the line. We need to focus on passing those liberal policies now. Helena's approach is solid, Mark's being cautious for no reason, and Kyve's just being Kyve. Let's just vote YES and move on."

Kyve is the president candidate, they have choosen tom as their channcellor candidate
---
Tom: "Hey guys, great discussion so far! Max's yes vote is definitely suspicious, but let's not jump to conclusions. I think we should focus on finding those fascist policies instead of accusing each other. Tom as Chancellor candidate is a great choice for Kyve, btw. Can we discuss what kind of policies we're looking for first? Should we prioritize liberal or...?"
---
Mark: "Hey guys, I'm a bit concerned about Kyve's sudden change of heart. 2 no votes are already suspicious when considering their presidential run, and now Max votes yes? That's some interesting behavior. Let's not focus too much on who's 'good guy' or 'bad guy' yet, but rather, let's discuss the liberal policies we're looking for. What do you think is our priority - passing those policy cards?"
---
Melanie: "I agree Tom's a strong choice for Chancellor, but let's keep a close eye on Max's vote. I'm still not convinced about Kyve's intentions. What do we think about passing a policy that investigates roles? Maybe we can clear some things up and get a better idea of who we're dealing with."
---
Helena: "Uh, yeah... I think we should, like, focus on those policies, too... *nervous laugh* I mean, if we're not careful, someone's gonna try to, you know, manipulate us or something... *pauses* So, let's just talk about what kind of policies we're looking for, huh? Like, what are the options again? And, um, Tom's idea about investigating roles sounds super interesting... *trails off* I'm still a bit confused about Max's vote, though... *leans in slightly* Does anyone else think that might be suspicious?"
---
Kyve: "Guys, chill out, Tom's right. We can't just jump to conclusions here. Max's change of heart is suspicious, but let's keep that in mind for now. I'd rather focus on our own policies first. Melanie, your idea about investigating roles is a good one. It might help us clear some things up. But, you know what? I think we're all just getting a bit too paranoid. Can we agree to table this discussion and move forward with the game? We can discuss this later if needed. Tom's as Chancellor candidate still looks good to me."
---
Max: "Vote YES. We can't afford to pass up opportunities to enact fascist policies. Investigating roles is a great idea, Melanie. Let's get that done ASAP and see if we can uncover any suspicious activity."

Tom: "Hey guys, just wanted to make sure everyone is on the same page. We've got Max as president candidate and I'm honored to be chosen as his chancellor candidate. Let's focus on passing some good policies for our country. Tom thinks we should start with a policy on education. Who's with me?"
---
Mark: "I'm just glad everyone is on board with Max as president candidate and Tom as chancellor candidate. Education policy does seem like a good starting point, I think we can all agree that our children's future is at stake. Let's get Tom started on researching those policies."
---
Melanie: "Hey everyone, just want to reiterate how important education is for our country's future. I think we can all agree that Tom's proposal on education policy is a great starting point. Let's not waste any time and get him started on researching those policies."
---
Helena: "Hey guys, I'm just so excited about this! Education policy does sound like a great place to start, doesn't it? I mean, who's really against that? *nervous laugh* I think we can all agree that our children's future is at stake... and Tom's proposal is definitely the way to go. Can I just ask, has anyone else had a chance to review the policy cards yet?"
---
Kyve: "Hey guys, let's keep it civil here. I'm down with Tom's education policy, but can we make sure no one's wasting time? We gotta stay focused and get this done before next round."
---
Max: "Vote YES! We can't waste any time on debating, let's just get this education policy done already!"

---
Tom: "Hey guys, I'm glad we've got Melanie as Chancellor! As President, I think it's really important that we keep the conversation open and make sure everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts. Before we proceed, can we please take a moment to clarify what happened with Max and the policy? Maybe we can get some more details on that? And, @Melanie, how do you feel about our strategy moving forward?"
---
Mark: "Hey guys, let's keep the conversation open, but also be honest about what happened. @Max, can you tell us more about how that policy got played? And @Melanie, as our Chancellor, do you think we should be investigating Max's vote?"
---
Melanie: "Hey guys, sounds good to me about keeping the conversation open! @Tom, I appreciate your willingness to discuss what happened. As for the policy, it seems like we can't change what's been done, but let's focus on the fact that we have a clear fascist policy now. Considering our current government is still in place, I think we should keep investigating and try not to get too comfortable with how things are going."
---
Helena: "Hey guys, I'm just so glad we're all on the same page here! *nervous laugh* I don't want to be too paranoid, but can we please clarify what Max meant by saying he got played? I feel like we should try to understand what happened and maybe even look into it a bit more. But at the same time, I trust @Melanie as our Chancellor and think she's doing a great job so far. Maybe we can just focus on making sure everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas?"
---
Kyve: "Hey guys, I think we're just trying to sweep it under the rug, but let's not forget what happened. @Max, can you really tell us what happened with that policy? It sounds fishy. And @Melanie, as our Chancellor, do you want to clarify if there's any chance this is a setup to make us look bad?"
---
Max: "Vote YES! We can't let the game drag on like this. It's time to get serious about passing some policies. We need to keep our focus on the task at hand and not get distracted by speculation. Let's just move forward and make sure we're all on the same page."

---
Tom: I think we're off to a interesting start! Kyve and Max both voted yes, but let's make sure we're not rushing into anything. I'll vote yes as well, but can we take a closer look at the policies that got played? Maybe there's something we missed. And hey Mark, thanks for considering me as your Chancellor candidate, it's an honor!
---
Mark: "Thanks Tom, I appreciate your vote of confidence! Given Max and Kyve both voted yes, let's indeed take a closer look at those policies. As President candidate, I'll make sure we do a thorough investigation. Anyone have any concerns or insights about the policies that were played?"
---
Melanie: "Hey guys, I think we should definitely review those policy cards. Let's get a closer look at each one and make sure we're not missing anything important. Can we take a moment to discuss each card individually? Maybe we can find something that gives us more insight into what's going on."
---
Helena: "Hey guys, I'm a bit confused about what we're seeing here. We've got Tom getting played by a fascist policy, and now we've got Mark being very transparent about his intentions as President candidate... I mean, that's not really suspicious at all, right? *nervous laugh* Anyway, I think we should take a closer look at those policies, like Melanie said. Let's go through each one individually and see if there's anything we're missing. But can we also keep an eye on Mark's... um, presidential campaign? Just to make sure everything is above board?"
---
Kyve: "Hey guys, I'm a bit concerned about Mark's intentions as President candidate. I mean, he's being super transparent about it, almost too much so? Let's not jump to conclusions, but can we at least take a closer look at those policies and see if there's anything fishy going on? And Tom, your vote of confidence is appreciated, but let's focus on the policies for now. We don't want to get sidetracked."
---
Max: "Come on guys, let's just vote yes already! We can review the policies later, but I'm not seeing any reason to overthink this. We're all liberal here, we want to pass some good policies, right? Tom, your vote of confidence is appreciated, but let's focus on moving forward. Kyve, don't worry about Mark, he's just trying to play it safe. Let's support each other and move this game forward. Vote yes!"

Tom: "Alright guys, let's take a look at the results of the voting for Mark. It's not surprising to see no votes for him, I mean we all know how that would go. But seriously, 3 yes and 3 no. That's pretty split. I think we should focus on getting Helena as our Chancellor candidate though. She seems like a strong leader. What do you guys think? Should we be focusing on liberal policies or passing some fascist ones?"
---
Mark: "I don't know, guys. I think we should at least consider Helena as our Chancellor candidate. She seems like a strong leader. Maybe we can discuss liberal policies later if we need to? But for now, let's focus on getting her elected."
---
Melanie: "I think Tom makes a good point about focusing on Helena as our Chancellor candidate. We should at least consider her as an option. But before we proceed, can we discuss what policies were available and how they might play out? Maybe we can rule some of them out based on their potential impact."
---
Helena: "I'm really open to discussing our options, but I think we should keep it simple for now. Let's focus on passing a liberal policy first and see how that goes. We can always reassess and adjust later. I mean, we do want to get Helena elected as Chancellor, right? But let's not overthink it too much. What do you guys think about... 'Liberal Policy X'? Should we at least consider moving forward with that?"
---
Kyve: "Wait a minute, guys... I don't know if this is really the right time for liberal policies yet. We just met Helena and we need to make sure she's on our side before we start pushing those agendas. Tom, I think you're being too hasty with your support for fascist policies. Can we at least table that discussion for now? Helena, what do you think about focusing on getting her elected as Chancellor first? And let's keep an open mind about the liberal policies, but also be cautious not to throw everything out just yet."
---
Max: "Vote YES â€” this combo has passed liberal policy last time and neither is suspicious yet. We should keep the momentum going, Helena's got a good vibe about her, let's not rock the boat."

Helena is the president candidate, they have choosen mark as their channcellor candidate
---
Tom: "Hey guys, thanks for being open about sharing the voting results. Just to clarify, we now know Helena is our President candidate and Mark is her Chancellor candidate. That's some strong support there! As a Liberal, I'm gonna try to keep an eye on everyone's behavior, but I think it's safe to say we should focus on passing more liberal policies to move forward. Anyone got any thoughts on how to get us closer to our goal?"
---
Mark: "Hey guys, thanks for the clarification. I'm a bit surprised by Helena's President candidate status and my own Chancellor candidate choice, but I guess it's not surprising given our conversation earlier. As we discussed, passing liberal policies is key, so I'll try to keep an eye on everyone's behavior without jumping to conclusions. Has anyone got any thoughts on how we can get more liberal policies passed?"
---
Melanie: "Hey guys, thanks for the clarification. I think Tom's right, we should focus on passing more liberal policies to move forward. Let's keep a close eye on Helena and Mark's behavior, see if they're being too pushy with their fascist agenda. Anyone got any thoughts on how to get us closer to our goal?"
---
Helena: "Hey guys, I think Tom's right, we should focus on passing more liberal policies to move forward. Maybe we can try to investigate Mark's role or get some more info on Helena's president candidate status? Just a thought."
---
Kyve: "Uh, guys, I don't know if this is relevant but... can we please keep an eye on Mark? He's always talking about how he's not sure who to trust. Like, come on, if you're not even sure, why are you saying that out loud? And Helena's being super pushy with her president candidate status. Can we just vote NO on the government thing now and move on?"
---
Max: "Vote YES, we gotta move forward with this policy! We can't just let Helena's pushy behavior dictate our moves. And let's be real, Tom's been doing some good work here. We should trust him and keep an eye on Mark, make sure he doesn't get too sneaky."

---
Tom: "Hey guys, nice to see we're all on the same page! Since Kyve is our president candidate and Tom here is their chosen chancellor, I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. Given that Max voted yes and the result of the vote for Helena was no, 5 to 1, I'm inclined to trust my instincts and follow Max's lead this time. Tom as chancellor seems like a solid choice. Shall we move forward with passing the liberal policy?"
---
Mark: "Hey guys, I'm not sure if it's just me, but Tom's words seem a bit... rehearsed? Given Max's vote and Helena's no, I think we should investigate Kyve's role more. Anyone got any thoughts?"
---
Melanie: "Hey guys, thanks for sharing your thoughts. I think Mark raises a valid point - let's not be too hasty. Given the votes and the fact that Helena wasn't passed, it seems like we should keep our eyes open for potential roles. Max's vote could just as easily be a genuine attempt to pass liberal policy, but without more info on Kyve's role, I'm inclined to side with Mark - let's do an investigation."
---
Helena: "Hey guys, I think we're all getting a bit ahead of ourselves. Mark's right, Tom's words did seem a bit rehearsed. But at the same time, Max's vote does feel genuine, and we can't just dismiss that. I'm inclined to trust Max's instincts this time, but let's not rush into anything without more info on Kyve's role. How about we try to gather more information before making any decisions? Maybe we can get some clarity on the policy cards?"
---
Kyve: "Guys, come on! We're just trying to play this game here. Let's focus on passing a policy already! Tom's words might've been rehearsed, but Max said they voted yes and we can't just dismiss that. I'm tired of all these investigations and back-and-forth. If anyone's got a problem with it, let's just vote on the policy and be done with it."
---
Max: "Come on guys, let's not overcomplicate things! We've got a clear liberal policy combo here and it's been passed 5 times already. Tom's words might've seemed rehearsed, but we can't deny the votes. We should trust Max's instincts this time, he's been consistent. Let's just focus on passing the next policy and moving forward."

Tom: "Hey guys, let's focus on getting this government right. We can't afford to make any mistakes now. I'm worried about Kyve's vote, though - 4 yes, 2 no is pretty suspicious. Should we investigate him?"
---
Mark: "Hey guys, I'm a bit concerned about Kyve's vote too. 4 yes is definitely suspicious, especially when we had 2 no. We can't afford to be reckless here. I think we should investigate him, see if there's any evidence of foul play."
---
Melanie: "Guys, let's keep this discussion focused on the vote results. Tom makes a good point about Kyve's vote being suspicious. I'm not sure what to make of it yet, but let's keep an open mind and not jump to conclusions. Mark, do you think we should really investigate him? Maybe we can discuss that later when more info comes up."
---
Helena: "Hey guys, I'm a bit concerned about Tom's suggestion. We can't just accuse someone based on one vote, right? Let's focus on our own policies for now. I still think we should prioritize getting some liberal policies passed, though. Who's with me?"
---
Kyve: "Guys, calm down. We can't just start accusing people left and right. That's not how this works. I'm telling you, my vote was a coincidence. I didn't even think about it that much. Let's focus on passing some policies, yeah? We need to move forward, not backward. Who's with me on liberal policy 3?"
---
Max: "Guys, come on! We can't waste time investigating each other. Let's focus on passing our policies! Who's with me on liberal policy 3? It's a no-brainer, we need to keep moving forward."

---
Tom: "Hey guys, I just want to clarify the situation here. We've got a very concerning situation when Max played that policy without us knowing its result beforehand. Can we discuss this as a group and try to figure out what's going on? Maybe we can establish some ground rules for future votes to ensure everyone's on the same page."
---
Mark: "Hey guys, let's keep the conversation civil. We've already had a bit of a scare with Max's policy play. I think Melanie's suggestion about ground rules is a good one. How about we make it so that everyone has to ask before playing a new policy, just to give us all a heads up?"
---
Melanie: "I think Tom's idea about asking before playing a new policy is a great starting point. It'll definitely help prevent any more surprises like this. Let's discuss and agree on some ground rules for future votes."

Helena: "I think we're all on the same page here. Let's make sure to respect each other's boundaries and ask before playing new policies. It's better to be safe than sorry, right? I'm good with asking first, it makes me feel more comfortable."
---
Kyve: "Alright guys, let's not overcomplicate things. We've got a situation where we need to establish some ground rules for future votes. Max's outburst was unprofessional and we can't have that kind of behavior in this game. I'm good with asking before playing new policies, it's better to be safe than sorry. But let's keep the conversation civil, no need to accuse each other or make assumptions. We're all adults here, right? Tom?"
---
Max: "I'm good with asking before playing new policies. It's better to be safe than sorry. Let's keep it civil and make sure everyone's on the same page. Tom's outburst was a bit much, but we can move forward from here."

Policy liberal got played by Tom and melanie.
---
Mark is the president candidate, they have choosen tom as their channcellor candidate
---
Tom: "Hey guys, I think we should focus on passing some liberal policies instead of trying to figure out who's fascist or not. We've got a good majority saying yes, so let's keep that momentum going! Who's up for voting yes again?"
---
Mark: "Alright guys, I think Tom's right. We do have a good momentum going with the yes votes. But let's make sure we're not missing anything crucial. Can we take a closer look at the policy that just got played? Was it a liberal one?"
---
Melanie: "I'm not sure what Tom means by 'focus on passing liberal policies.' That seems a bit... suspicious coming from him, considering we just got burned by a liberal policy being played by him earlier. Can we at least investigate what happened with that policy? Maybe there's more to it than we think?"
---
Helena: "I don't know what Melanie means by 'suspicious,' but I do think it's weird that Tom is suddenly pushing for liberal policies after we just had one get played by him. Can we really trust his vote? Maybe we should look into the history of that policy and see if there's anything fishy going on."
---
Kyve: "Yo, what's up guys? I'm all for keeping the momentum going, but let's not forget we got some new info just now. Tom's trying to spin this liberal thingy, but I think it's better to take a closer look at that policy again. You never know what might've been hiding in plain sight. Who's down to investigate?"
---
Max: "Come on guys, let's not overthink this! Tom's right, we do have a good momentum going with yes votes. We can't let a little thing like a past liberal policy scare us off. I'm voting yes again, and I suggest we all just keep moving forward. Who's with me?"

Tom: "Hey guys, I think we should focus on passing some liberal policies first. We can't let the fascists get too far ahead. I'm voting yes for Mark's proposal, but I want to make sure we're all on the same page about what that means. Can we discuss more about it?"
---
Mark: "Alright guys, thanks for the discussion. I think Tom's right, we should focus on passing some liberal policies first. Let's not get ahead of ourselves here. If we vote yes on my proposal, it'll be a big step forward for our team. But we need to make sure we're all clear on what that means and how we can work together to achieve it. Tom, your insight is really valuable, can you help us understand the reasoning behind your decision? And @Melanie, as President candidate, how do you plan to handle any potential fascist attempts to undermine our progress?"
---
Melanie: "Tom's approach seems reasonable. I'm inclined to agree with him, but I want to make sure we're clear about our intentions. @Max, can you clarify why you voted yes for Mark's proposal? Is there something specific that makes it appealing to you?"
---
Helena: "Hey guys, I'm still a bit confused about what Mark's proposal is exactly... Can we take a closer look at it? Maybe we can even discuss how our goals align with his plan?"
---
Kyve: "Alright guys, I think we're all getting ahead of ourselves here. We can't just focus on liberal policies without knowing what Mark's proposal even is! Can we take a closer look at it? I'm voting yes to see what's going on, but I need some clarification from Max about why he voted for it."
---
Max: "Alright guys, let's get down to business! We need to pass this policy if we wanna have any chance at stopping those fascists! I'm voting yes, no questions asked!"

Helena is the president candidate, they have choosen melanie as their channcellor candidate
---
Tom: "Hey guys, just a heads up that we should really consider Helena's presidency at this point. With 3 votes for Melanie and 3 against, I'm not sure if she'd be the best choice. Maybe we can discuss and see what others think?"
---
Mark: "Hey guys, I'm still trying to wrap my head around Melanie's chancellorship. Three votes for her and three against, it's definitely a swing vote. Has anyone had a chance to talk to Helena about her presidency? Maybe we should really consider her at this point?"
---
Melanie: "Guys, I think Tom's right. We can't just go along with a 3-3 split on my chancellorship. Can we at least talk to Helena about her presidency? Maybe we can get some more info on her stance and see if that changes anything?"
---
Helena: "Guys, I think we should take Mark's point into consideration. We can't make a decision based on just one vote, right? I mean, Helena's presidency might be a better option if we can get more info on her stance. Can we at least talk to her about it? Maybe she can shed some light on what she'd do as president?"
---
Kyve: "Ugh, Tom's right, we can't make a decision here. Let's talk to Helena about her presidency instead of just assuming she's bad. Maybe Mark is just trying to stir up trouble. Can we at least discuss and get some more info? I don't think we should just vote for Melanie or Helena without knowing what they'd really do."
---
Max: "Guys, I'm down with whatever decision we make. But if I had to say, I think we should vote for Helena's presidency. We gotta get more info, right? Can we really trust Melanie's chancellorship after this 3-3 split?"

---
Tom: "Hey guys, just wanted to clarify a few things before we move forward. I'm not sure if anyone's noticed, but Kyve was pretty adamant about voting no earlier. That does seem suspicious to me. Also, I'm still trying to wrap my head around what happened with Helena and Melanie's policy being played by... whoever it was. Can we get a better understanding of what that means for our next steps? Maybe we can discuss as a group how we should proceed?"
---
Mark: "Alright guys, let's keep it civil. I think Tom raises a valid point about Kyve's behavior earlier. I'm still trying to understand what happened with Helena and Melanie's policy too. Can we get a clearer explanation from the President-elect? Perhaps we can discuss how to move forward in a way that respects everyone's trust?"
---
Melanie: "Hey guys, I think we need to take Tom's comment seriously. Kyve's behavior does seem suspicious, especially after being adamant about voting no earlier. We should definitely ask the President-elect for a clearer explanation of what happened with Helena and Melanie's policy. Perhaps we can have a more in-depth discussion about how to handle this situation and rebuild trust."
---
Helena: I think Tom brings up some valid concerns. I'm still trying to wrap my head around what happened with my policy being played too. Can we get a better understanding of what that means for our next steps? Maybe we can discuss as a group how we should proceed and see if we can figure out who might be behind this kind of behavior.
---
Kyve: "Alright guys, let's not get ahead of ourselves here. I know we all have concerns, but we need to keep the focus on moving forward. We've got a Chancellor to elect and some policies to discuss. Let's take a deep breath and try to move past this. Tom, can you clarify what exactly is bothering you about my earlier vote? Was it just a difference of opinion or something more? And Helena, I know your policy was played by someone... but we don't even know who did it yet. Can we please not jump to conclusions?"
---
Max: "Vote YES. I think we're just getting started and it's better to be safe than sorry. We can discuss Kyve's behavior later, let's focus on electing a President for now."

Tom: "Hey guys, I think we should focus on getting Max elected Chancellor first. We don't want to give Kyve too much power yet. Let's make sure to vote for him and then we can discuss further about our policies."
---
Mark: "Hey guys, I agree we don't want to give Kyve too much power just yet. But I think we should focus on passing some liberal policies first. We can always revisit our strategy after Max is in a position of power."
---
Melanie: "Hey guys, I think we're getting ahead of ourselves by focusing on Max or Kyve for Chancellor just yet. Can we take a step back and prioritize passing some liberal policies first? We need to get a better understanding of each other's goals and make sure we're not inadvertently helping the other team. Let's keep an open mind and discuss our options further."
---
Helena: "Hey guys, I think we're all getting a bit ahead of ourselves. I'm still trying to wrap my head around everything that's happening. Can we just focus on passing some liberal policies for now? Maybe we can try to figure out who's being suspicious or not later on. I mean, Melanie's right, we need to make sure we're not inadvertently helping the other team. Let's take a step back and discuss our options further. Who's with me?"
---
Kyve: "Uh, guys, I don't know about all this Max stuff. But if we're gonna pass some policies, let's focus on making sure Kyve doesn't get too powerful, you know? We can't have him running around like a loose cannon. And Melanie's right, we need to be careful not to give away our hand or help the other team out. I'm still not convinced about Tom's idea of voting for Max yet. Let's just stick to passing liberal policies and see what happens, okay?"
---
Max: "Vote YES, we need to keep pushing forward and see what we can achieve. Tom's idea of voting for Max makes sense, let's just take a step back and focus on passing liberal policies for now."

---
Tom: "Hey guys, just a heads up, since Max's vote went in favor, I'm going to make sure we investigate his role. Melanie seems like a great choice as Chancellor candidate, but let's keep an eye on things moving forward. Tom."
---
Mark: "I think we should keep an open mind about Max's sudden change of heart. If he really did play a liberal policy, it could be a clever move to get us to investigate him. I'm not sure if I trust Tom's new investigation plan just yet. Let's keep our eyes on the policy cards and see how they play out."
---
Melanie: "Guys, I think we should focus on the new policy instead of Max's vote. It's still early in the game and we don't have enough info to make any accusations yet. Tom's suggestion to investigate him might be a good idea, but let's do it after we see how the policy plays out."
---
Helena: "Hey guys, I'm still trying to wrap my head around Max's vote. It does seem suspicious that he just changed his mind like that. I think we should keep an eye on him, but let's not jump to conclusions yet. What do you guys think? Maybe we can discuss the policy card and see if it gives us any clues?"
---
Kyve: "Folks, let's keep the focus on the policy card for now. We don't want to jump to conclusions about Max's vote just yet. Melanie's right, we need more info before we make any accusations. Tom's suggestion to investigate Max is a good one, but let's do it after we see how this new policy plays out. I'm not saying it's suspicious or anything, but... you know, better safe than sorry, right?"
---
Max: "Guys, let's keep it moving forward! We don't want to get sidetracked by rumors or speculation. I'm voting YES for the policy. Let's focus on the task at hand and not jump to conclusions about anyone's actions. Next!"
