# AI-Agent Framework

This is a minimal framework for experimenting with AI agents, developed at FHGR. It allows for simulation-based agent behavior and data collection through MongoDB.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:** This framework is primarily intended for internal or educational use at FHGR. It is not production-ready, lacks extensive documentation and testing, and is not widely adopted. For building robust and production-grade AI agents, consider using mature frameworks such as **LangChain**, **Auto-GPT**, or **CrewAI**.

## üöÄ Getting Started

You can run the project using either **Docker** or **Apptainer** (for server environments).

### Option 1: Docker

```bash
docker build -t ai-agent-framework .
docker run -p 5000:5000 ai-agent-framework
```

### Option 2: Apptainer (on server)

```bash
./apptainer-build.sh
./apptainer-run.sh
```

## üß† Starting a Simulation

Once the system is running, you can start simulations via your browser or an HTTP client:

- Start a default simulation loop:
  ```
  http://localhost:5000/group/start/endless
  ```

- Start a simulation with a custom configuration:
  1. Create your own `.json` config file in the appropriate directory.
  2. Start with:
     ```
     http://localhost:5000/group/start/<yourConfigFileName>
     ```

## üì¶ MongoDB: Exporting & Importing Data

### Step 1: Install `mongodump`

```bash
wget https://fastdl.mongodb.org/tools/db/mongodb-database-tools-ubuntu2404-x86_64-100.12.0.tgz
tar -zxvf mongodb-database-tools-*.tgz
```

### Step 2: Dump Data from Server

```bash
./bin/mongodump --uri="mongodb://localhost:27017" --out=/tmp/mongo_backup
```

### Step 3: Transfer Data to Local Machine

```bash
scp -r username@server.fhgr.ch:/tmp/mongo_backup ./
```

### Step 4: Restore to Local MongoDB

Download and install the database tools for your OS:  
üîó https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools/installation/installation-windows/

Then run:

```bash
mongorestore --uri="mongodb://root:example@localhost:27017/?authSource=admin" ./mongo_backup
```
